# Certificates Authority Server
This is the Certificate Authority (CA) server for managing SSL/TLS certificates. It is designed to issue, revoke, and manage certificates for secure communications.

**Notes that the CA server doesn't enable SSL/TLS by itself, becuase this is for development purpose only.*

Each organization should run its own CA server, and the CA server should be run in a secure environment.
